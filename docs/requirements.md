**Hackathon Task: Ticketing System**

*Participant Requirements Specification*

Build a small, working Kanban-style ticket tracker as a three-tier SPA
backed by an RDBMS.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Mandatory scope: authentication, teams, epics, tickets, comments,   |
| and a draggable Kanban board.**                                       |
|                                                                       |
| **Scrum, sprints, SSO, and advanced project-management features [are  |
| explicitly out of scope]{.underline}.**                               |
+=======================================================================+

# 1. Objective

Create a complete web application that allows registered users to
organize work tickets by team and move them through a fixed Kanban
workflow. The solution must demonstrate a functional user interface,
server-side business logic, and persistent relational storage.

# 2. Required Architecture

- Single-page application (SPA) frontend.

- Backend application exposing an HTTP API.

- Relational database management system (RDBMS) for all persistent
  application data.

- Clear separation between presentation, application/API, and
  persistence tiers.

- The frontend and backend may be deployed as separate containers, or
  the backend may serve the compiled SPA, provided the three logical
  tiers remain clearly separated.

- Use a dedicated server-based RDBMS container such as PostgreSQL.

- Programming languages and frameworks are unrestricted. The application
  must be cross-platform.

- From a clean checkout, the complete solution must start from the
  repository root with \`docker compose up \--build\`; no host-installed
  frontend, backend, or database runtime may be required beyond Docker
  Compose. The QA team must be able to run the application on a clean
  Windows, macOS, or Linux laptop.

# 3. User Accounts and Authentication

- Users can sign up using an email address and password. Email addresses
  are trimmed, compared case-insensitively, and must be unique.

- Users can log in and log out using local credentials. SSO and external
  identity providers are not required.

- Passwords must contain at least 8 characters, must never be stored in
  plain text, and must be hashed using an established password-hashing
  algorithm such as Argon2id.

- After sign-up, the system sends an email-verification message through
  a configurable SMTP service. The implementation must support
  relay1.dataart.com.

- A newly registered account cannot use the main application until the
  email address is verified.

- Verification links or tokens expire after 24 hours and are single-use.
  A successful verification leads the user to the login screen;
  automatic login is not required.

- An unverified user can request a new verification email from the login
  or verification-result screen. Issuing a new token invalidates earlier
  unused tokens.

- All business application screens and API endpoints require
  authentication, except sign-up, login, email verification, and
  verification-email resend. Static frontend assets and optional
  health/readiness endpoints may remain public.

# 4. Teams

- Tickets are grouped by team.

- Authenticated users can view the list of teams and create, rename, and
  delete teams.

- A team has at least: identifier, name, created timestamp, and modified
  timestamp.

- Team names must be non-empty after trimming and unique
  case-insensitively.

- A team cannot be deleted while it contains tickets or epics. The UI
  must show a clear validation message; cascading deletion of a team is
  not allowed.

- Team ownership and membership are not part of the mandatory scope. All
  verified users can view and manage all teams.

# 5. Epics

- Each epic belongs to exactly one team.

- The team is selected when the epic is created and cannot be changed
  later. Moving an epic between teams is out of scope.

- Provide a separate screen for epic CRUD operations: create, list,
  edit, and delete.

- An epic has at least: identifier, team reference, title, optional
  description, created timestamp, and modified timestamp.

- Epic titles must be non-empty after trimming.

- A ticket may optionally reference one epic, selected from a drop-down
  list.

- A ticket may reference only an epic that belongs to the same team as
  the ticket; the backend must enforce this relationship.

- An epic cannot be deleted while tickets reference it. The UI must show
  a clear validation message.

# 6. Tickets

Each ticket must contain the following fields:

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Field**   **Required**   **Allowed values / type**  **Notes**
  ----------- -------------- -------------------------- --------------------------------
  ID          Yes            System-generated           Stable and unique.
                             identifier                 

  Team        Yes            Reference to a team        Determines the team board. Must
                                                        reference an existing team.

  Type        Yes            bug \| feature \| fix      Use exactly these three values.
                                                        They are classification labels
                                                        only; no different workflow
                                                        behavior is required for bug,
                                                        feature, or fix.

  State       Yes            new \|                     These are the canonical API
                             ready_for_implementation   values. The UI should display
                             \| in_progress \|          human-readable labels with
                             ready_for_acceptance \|    spaces. The workflow is fixed;
                             done                       no custom states are required.

  Epic        No             Reference to an epic       Selected from the epic list for
                                                        the ticket's team. Must be null
                                                        or reference an epic from that
                                                        same team.

  Title       Yes            Text                       Must be non-empty after
                                                        trimming. It is intended as
                                                        short display text, but no
                                                        mandatory application-level
                                                        maximum length is specified.

  Body        Yes            Long text                  Must be non-empty. Plain text or
                                                        Markdown is acceptable;
                                                        rich-text editing is not
                                                        required. No mandatory
                                                        application-level maximum length
                                                        is specified.

  Created at  Yes            Timestamp                  Set by the server in UTC when
                                                        the ticket is created.

  Modified at Yes            Timestamp                  Set by the server in UTC
                                                        whenever ticket fields or state
                                                        change. Adding a comment does
                                                        not change it.

  Created by  Yes            Reference to user          Set automatically from the
                                                        authenticated user.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ticket operations:

- Create a ticket.

- Open and view all ticket fields, including created by, created at, and
  modified at.

- Edit ticket type, team, epic, title, body, and state.

- The modified timestamp represents the latest actual ticket field or
  state change. Saving unchanged values must not advance it.

- When a ticket's team changes, the UI must clear or replace any
  selected epic. The backend must reject a ticket whose epic belongs to
  a different team.

- Delete a ticket after an explicit confirmation. Deleting a ticket also
  deletes its comments.

- State changes performed by drag-and-drop must be persisted immediately
  in the database.

- The backend must validate all submitted enum values and references;
  client-side validation alone is insufficient.

# 7. Comments

- Authenticated users can add comments to a ticket.

- A comment contains: identifier, ticket reference, author, body, and
  created timestamp.

- Comment bodies must be non-empty.

- Comments are displayed chronologically, oldest first.

- Adding a comment does not update the ticket modified timestamp and
  therefore does not change the ticket's board ordering.

- Comments are immutable after creation for the mandatory scope. Editing
  and deleting comments may be implemented as stretch features.

# 8. Kanban Board

- The primary screen is a Kanban board for one selected team.

- The board contains exactly five columns, one for each ticket state, in
  workflow order.

- Each ticket is displayed as a card showing at least its title and
  type. Showing its epic is recommended.

- Users can drag a ticket card from one column to another. Dropping a
  card changes its state and persists the change through the backend
  API.

- If a drag-and-drop update fails, the card must return to its previous
  column and the UI must display an error.

- Cards may be moved directly between any two states; enforcing
  sequential transitions is not required.

- Within a column, cards are ordered by most recently modified first.
  Persisting a custom manual order is not required.

- The board must provide a clear way to create a ticket and open an
  existing ticket.

- At minimum, provide filtering by ticket type and epic, plus a
  case-insensitive substring search over ticket title. Active filters
  are combined using AND logic and may be implemented client-side or
  server-side.

- The interface must remain usable with at least 100 tickets on one team
  board.

# 9. API and Persistence Expectations

- All create, update, and delete operations must be performed through
  the backend API and persisted in the RDBMS.

- The application must not rely on browser local storage as the system
  of record.

- Use database constraints and/or server-side validation to maintain
  referential integrity.

- Return meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages for validation
  failures, authentication failures, missing records, and conflicts.
  Attempts to delete a team that contains tickets or epics, or an epic
  referenced by tickets, should return HTTP 409 Conflict.

- Identifiers may be UUIDs or database-generated numeric values. API
  timestamps must use an ISO-8601 representation in UTC.

- Cookie-based sessions or bearer-token authentication are both
  acceptable. Session identifiers, access tokens, and bearer tokens must
  not be placed in URLs. A single-use email-verification token may be
  included in the verification URL.

- Concurrent-edit conflict detection is not required; last successful
  write wins.

- Database schema creation must be automated through migrations or an
  equivalent repeatable initialization mechanism.

- After migrations or initialization complete, a fresh database must
  contain no application users, teams, epics, tickets, or comments.
  Migration metadata is allowed. The default startup path must not load
  sample or seed data; QA will create test data through the application
  UI or API.

# 10. Minimum Screens

- Sign-up screen.

- Email verification result screen.

- Verification-email resend action for unverified or expired-token
  cases.

- Login screen.

- Kanban board with team selector.

- Ticket create/edit/details view.

- Team management screen.

- Epic management screen.

# 11. Non-Functional Requirements

- Security: protect authenticated endpoints, hash passwords, validate
  input, and avoid exposing credentials or SMTP secrets in source
  control.

- Reliability: a browser refresh or application restart must not lose
  persisted data.

- Usability: display loading, empty, success, and error states where
  applicable.

- Compatibility: support a current desktop version of Chrome, Edge, or
  Firefox.

- Maintainability: include a README with prerequisites, configuration,
  startup commands.

- Testing: include automated tests covering at least one backend
  business flow and at least one frontend or API flow.

# 12. Explicitly Out of Scope

- Scrum functionality, sprints, backlogs, story points, velocity,
  burndown charts, or sprint planning.

- SSO, OAuth login, corporate identity integration, or social login.

- Fine-grained roles, administrators, team membership, private teams, or
  per-ticket access control.

- File attachments, notifications, mentions, watchers, audit history,
  and real-time multi-user updates.

- Custom workflows, custom ticket types, subtasks, dependencies, time
  tracking, and reporting dashboards.

- Production deployment, high availability, and production-grade mail
  infrastructure.

# 13. Definition of Done

- **☐ A user can sign up, receive a verification email through the
  configured SMTP service, verify the account, and log in.**

- **☐** Teams and epics can be managed through the UI and persist in the
  database.

- **☐** A verified user can create, view, edit, and delete tickets.

- **☐** A user can add comments and see their author and timestamp.

- **☐** The Kanban board shows tickets in the correct state columns for
  the selected team.

- **☐** Dragging a ticket to another column updates the server and
  remains correct after refreshing the page.

- [ ] The application can be started from a clean checkout with \`docker
  compose up \--build\` from the repository root.

- **☐** The solution contains no hard-coded user password or committed
  secret.

- [ ] A fresh database starts with schema and migration metadata only;
  no application data is preloaded.

- [ ] QA can create all required test or demo data through the
  application UI or API without manually changing database records.

# 14. Optional Stretch Features

- Password reset flow.

- Edit or delete own comments.

- Ticket activity history.

- Virtualized rendering for large boards.

# 15. Reference Wireframes

These low-fidelity wireframes illustrate the expected information
hierarchy and primary user flows. They are not a required visual design:
participants may use a different layout as long as all mandatory actions
and states remain clear and usable. The collapsed user menu shown in the
header is expected to include Log out. Disabled delete controls indicate
records that cannot currently be deleted because they are referenced.
